telegram bot weather and currency rates
Telegram Bot that gives actual information of currency rates and tempeture conditions about a given place. 
Developed on the asynchronous library aiogram.

Bot has next features:
- takes current rates from monobank
- with web crapping implemented currency codes provided from Monobank are linked to currency names
- full information about currency rates if provided is sent as the answer
- additional feateure: weather temperaute is sent if place is given and suits to opeanweather db. 

My first bot to get acquainted with aiogram, asynchronous programming, urllib3, requests, lxml (scrapping), token autorisations.
